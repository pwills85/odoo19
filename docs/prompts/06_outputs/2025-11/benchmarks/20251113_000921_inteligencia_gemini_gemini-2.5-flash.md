This code defines `AccountMoveDTE`, an extension of Odoo's `account.move` model for Chilean Electronic Tax Documents (DTE). It adds DTE-specific fields like `dte_status`, `dte_code`, and `dte_folio` to manage the DTE lifecycle. The implementation focuses on extending existing Odoo functionalities rather than duplicating them, and uses native Python libraries for DTE generation.
